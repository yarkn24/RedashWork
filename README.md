1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to **Pages** section
3. Under **Source**, select "GitHub Actions"
4. Push your changes to the `main` branch
5. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy your site

Your site will be available at: `https://yarkn24.github.io/RedashWork/`

## üîë API Key

The Confluence API key is already embedded in the application. For security in production:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
